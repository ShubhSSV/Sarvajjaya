                <p><strong>Season:</strong> Sarvajjaya thrives in both the spring and summer seasons when it flourishes under ample sunlight and warmer temperatures. During these seasons, the plant undergoes vigorous growth, with its leaves, flowers, and roots developing their highest concentration of beneficial compounds. Although it can be grown in milder climates year-round, its peak growth and vitality occur from late spring to mid-summer, making these the best seasons for harvesting its medicinal parts for optimal potency.</p>

                <p><strong>Region:</strong> Native to the fertile soils of South and Southeast Asia, the Sarvajjaya plant grows abundantly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its adaptability allows it to thrive across a range of altitudes, from coastal plains to mountainous areas, though it prefers well-drained soils and humid climates. Due to its extensive use in Ayurvedic and traditional Eastern medicine, it is cultivated widely in India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia, where the climate and soil conditions contribute to its rich nutrient profile.</p>

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> The Sarvajjaya plant is a perennial, meaning it lives and thrives for multiple years, often reaching peak maturity around 3-5 years of age. At this stage, the plant has developed a robust root system, and its leaves and flowers are at their most potent. With proper care, a mature Sarvajjaya plant can continue to provide beneficial yields for medicinal purposes over many years, making it a sustainable choice for long-term cultivation and use in traditional healing practices.</p>
